# Nasim Hossain  

Hi, I’m **Nasim Hossain**—a **Junior Software Engineer** at **Dynamic Solution Innovators (DSi)** with over **one year of industry experience** 💻. I’ve worked on real-world production environments, where I maintained servers, handled live issues, and ensured system stability and smooth deployments.

I have hands-on experience with **AWS services** such as **EC2, S3, and IAM**, along with **PM2** for process management and production monitoring 🚀. Currently, I’m working as a **Backend Engineer** on an **ASP.NET Core** project, while also diving deep into **DevOps culture**, automation, and **CI/CD pipelines** using tools like **Docker** and **GitHub Actions**.

I’m a certified **RHCSA (Red Hat Certified System Administrator)** 🐧, and I’m actively expanding my cloud knowledge by exploring **Microsoft Azure** ☁️.

Alongside my professional journey, I have a strong background in **Competitive Programming**, having solved **2,500+ problems** across various platforms 🏆—which has shaped my ability to think logically and solve complex engineering challenges efficiently.

Outside of work, you’ll often find me playing chess ♟️—planning strategies, learning from mistakes, and occasionally losing to a well-played gambit!

Join me as I share my journey through **software engineering, DevOps, Linux, and cloud computing** 🚀.
